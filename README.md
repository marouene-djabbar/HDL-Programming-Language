## HDL Language
HDL stands for Hardware Description Language. It's used to model the structure, design, and operation of digital logic circuits, allowing for the simulation and synthesis of digital systems before they are physically built.
## Using NAND gates
Using NAND gates to create various logic circuits is rooted in a fundamental concept in digital electronics known as functional completeness. NAND gates are functionally complete, which means that any boolean function or logic circuit can be constructed using only NAND gates.
